# Simple_web

Simple_web is a small React + Vite demo that shows how to fetch and display posts using Axios.
It includes a simple search component and a Post component to render results. The actual app
is inside the `axios/` subfolder (this repo uses a workspace layout).

## Quick summary

- Framework: React 19
- Bundler / dev server: Vite
- HTTP client: Axios
- Styling: (Tailwind is included as dependency in the project)

## Features

- Fetch posts from an API (see `src/api/Postapi.jsx`).
- Search/filter posts with `src/components/SearchCom.jsx`.
- Presentational `Post.jsx` component for each item.

## Project structure (important files)

Root
- `axios/` — the actual frontend project (contains package.json and Vite config)

Inside `axios/` (key files)
- `index.html` — app entry
- `src/main.jsx` — React entry
- `src/App.jsx` — main App component
- `src/api/Postapi.jsx` — API helper to fetch posts
- `src/components/Post.jsx` — Post item component
- `src/components/SearchCom.jsx` — Search component
- `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- pnpm (recommended since repo contains pnpm files) or npm/yarn

## Install and run

From the repository root you can use pnpm (recommended):

```bash
cd axios
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

If you prefer npm:

```bash
cd axios
npm install
npm run dev
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
cd axios
yarn
yarn dev
```

Available scripts (from `axios/package.json`):

- `dev` — start Vite dev server
- `build` — build for production
- `preview` — preview production build
- `lint` — run ESLint

## How it works (brief)

1. The app boots via Vite and `src/main.jsx`.
2. `App.jsx` uses the API helper in `src/api/Postapi.jsx` to fetch posts (Axios).
3. `SearchCom.jsx` filters posts client-side and `Post.jsx` renders each result.

## Notes & next steps

- Tests are not included; consider adding unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library).
- Add instructions for environment variables if the API base URL needs to be changed.
- Optionally add TypeScript typings for better DX.
